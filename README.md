# coronavirus_council_funding

In May 2020, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52491817) that emergency council funding during the crisis may not be sufficient to cover costs in some areas.

The second £1.6bn package was intended to support councils, which had been hit by a loss of income from parking, fines and taxes during the pandemic. This extra £1.6bn took the total given to councils to more than £3.2bn.

We compared the total allocation for each council to their populations and the amounts range from £43 to £73 per person.
